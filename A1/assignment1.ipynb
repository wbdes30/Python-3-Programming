    "# Assignment 1: Shall we play a game?\n",
    "\n",
    "By using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), you will create a program called _WordyPy_. In WordyPy, the bot you create\n",
    "must try to guess a five-letter secret word based on feedback given from the game engine. For each word guess your bot\n",
    "makes, the WordyPy game engine will give detailed feedback which your bot can use to increase its chances of winning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "The rules of WordyPy are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Each guess must be a five letter English word. Only the 26 letters of the English alphabet are used, and case does\n",
    "   not matter.\n",
    "2. The game engine, which is written for you, generates a hidden 5 letter word called the _target word_.\n",
    "3. The bot, which you must write, attempts to guess that word. It will get up to six tries.\n",
    "4. The bot will be given the location of a datafile which has a list of allowable words (one per line). Your bot must\n",
    "   read in this datafile and only make guesses from this datafile.\n",
    "5. After each guess the system provides feedback indicating if each character is in the correct position for the target\n",
    "   word, and if not, if the character is in the target word but in the wrong position.\n",
    "6. The bot must be \"smart\" in that once it has identified the correct location of a letter in a word it must only guess\n",
    "   future words where that letter is in the same position.\n",
    "7. We have written tests for these requirements; you must pass those tests to pass the assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "In order for your bot to play WordPy, you must implement two classes shown in the figure below (`Letter` and `Bot`) and\n",
    "write the python logic for each method of the two classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Architecture Diagram of WordyPy](architecture.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "A `Letter` indicates a single English letter from a guess, and has methods and attributes to describe whether the letter\n",
    "was in (or in the correct place) in the hidden target word.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Bot` class is your game playing agent! This class has two substantive methods in it:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `make_guess` which returns a string that is evaluated by the `GameEngine` and\n",
    "2. `record_guess_results` which takes the evaluation done by the `GameEngine` in order to ensure that the same guess is\n",
    "   never made twice **and** that your bot \"learns\" from previous guesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `GameEngine`, given to you at the bottom of this notebook, will control the game play. You don't have to write the\n",
    "`GameEngine` â€“ we've done that for you. However, the `GameEngine` will not work until you have correctly defined the\n",
    "`Letter` and `Bot` classess, including their methods. You will work on those!\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Test Your Bot\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have created the neccessary classes you should be able to test your bot by running this notebook. To verify it\n",
    "is passing our grading criteria, press the validate button on the toolbar. Once you have verified this you can try\n",
    "submitting to the autograder, which will evaluate our additional hidden unit tests and give you a grade -- don't worry,\n",
    "you can submit to the autograder as many times as you would like!\n",
    "\n",
    "You may wish to debug your `Bot` by playing a game with a shorter word list. We've included code for that at the bottom\n",
    "of this notebook for testing, but be aware that it will not work until your `Letter` and `Bot` classes have been\n",
    "implemented. Also, our final grader script will use a bigger dictionary of allowable words, so make sure you are\n",
    "thinking more generally about the problem and not hard coding any example words into your work!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Worked Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the output from an example run using the testing code provided. In this example five words were put into a text\n",
    "file called temp_file.txt. The game engine randomly picked a target word of `DOGGY` and the bot made three guesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first guess was the word `DRIVE` and the GameEngine provides the output of `D????` indicating that the first\n",
    "   letter is in the word and is in the correct position and the last four letters are not in the word anywhere.\n",
    "2. The bot then made the guess of `DADDY` and the GameEngine provides the output of `D?**Y` indicating that the first\n",
    "   and the last letters are in the word and in the correct location, the second letter from `DADDY` is not in the word\n",
    "   anywhere, and the third and fourth letters from `DADDY` are in the target word but not in those positions.\n",
    "3. The final guess made by the bot is the word `DOGGY`, which the game engine identifies as correct and finishes\n",
    "   **WordyPy**.\n",
    "\n",
